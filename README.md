# 🟡 Gold Price Prediction — Machine Learning Project

This project predicts **Gold Prices (GLD)** using important financial indicators such as  
the **S&P 500 Index (SPX)**, **Crude Oil price**, and **Silver price**.  
It is built as a **placement-ready machine learning project** to demonstrate skills in:

- Data analysis  
- Feature engineering  
- Machine learning model building  
- Visualization  
- Evaluation (R² Score)
